jee6-angular-sample
===================

This is my personal side project I worked on long time ago... I wanted to build a service for serving snapshots of webpages with dynamic js content. I stopped working on this though ;).

I played with several technologies here:
- JEE6
- JBoss AS 7
- JPA
- JAX-RS
- MySQL
- Apache 2 + mod\_proxy (serving static content)
- phantomjs (headless browser)
- angularjs + bootstrap 2.3 for frontend
